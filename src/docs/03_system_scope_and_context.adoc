== System Scope and Context


Our chat will allow real-time communication peer-to-peer with a decentralized structure. This means that 2 people can exchange information between them without depending in an external server, their information is never shared with anyone outside this direct communication channel. 

This is made possible thanks to the SOLID project. It allows each user to have it's own POD, kind of a personal server where all the information is stored, and through it connect themselves to different applications.

=== Business Context


The users are the communication elements sharing their information stored only in each one's POD. This information is composed by the own user's information plus the messages received from other users stored in a cache, as a way to provide a backup if something fails and make the process more agile.

The PODs are connected to our application (in JavaScript) in the web, which is the responsible to link both users and establish the channel, thanks to WebRTC.

=== Technical Context


In order to make this work we depend in the SOLID project as said before. We provide each user with a POD, the one they use our DeChat. Using the RDF library we establish the connection between users, and starting from this point there exists a private chat channel only from their POD to POD. The process is divided in two steps: 

* An identificator that ensures that the POD and the user's data match, and allows the user to enter in the second part, if everything is correct.
* A chat where users can establish the connection with other users and share information between them in our decentralized chat.
