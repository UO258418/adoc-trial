.User interface
Our application has a web interface with a side-menu that allows the user to view his friend list, and search it for specific results. This list includes group chats. The side menu also has a button to change the chat's settings and a butto to create new group chats.

The application also has a chat view to read and write messages to other users.

.WebRTC
Manages the requests of the app made to the user PODs, being able to hold them even when a POD is not available.

.DeChat POD interface
Rather than accessing to the raw data of a POD, each of them implements an interface that handles the requests of the app. It allows writing the links between the PODs and retrieving their information regarding DeChat.
